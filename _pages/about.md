MISH & JODI
Since we got together in 1996, we've felt that we complete each other, both in life and business. In 1998, Jodi started her career as a professional artist. After some small-scale independent exhibitions, we started joining bigger international shows where Jodi sold loads of her art, from originals to LE prints to commissions. She shared her skills and taught other artists about Giclee printing and how to use different software and tools, including Adobe Photoshop and Wacom Tablets.
During the pandemic, we were introduced to NFTs by a friend of ours. And we're hooked!
In March 2021, we joined Clubhouse to listen to and learn more about the world of NFTs and Web 3. We then moved to Twitter Spaces, where we expanded our knowledge further and started to build a strong community.
We wanted to find a way to hone our skills, share our knowledge and bring together our community of artists and collectors. So, we created The VECentre.

The VECentre
The VECentre is a virtual art platform connecting real life and The Metaverse, created by Artist Jodi.

Who can benefit from The VECentre?
Almost everyone can benefit!
The VECentre offers artists a free virtual platform to learn, promote, exhibit and sell their art NFTs whilst being a part of a community.
We're creating four annual shows to help a minimum of 100 artists per show for free: Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Between our core four shows, we'll offer virtual spaces for Cooperates, Galleries, Musicians, Architects, gamers, Filmmakers, Dancers, Charities and more.
As we grow, the VECentre will offer Mental Health support. We'll build a meditation room that will house links to different helpful resources.
The VEC will also offer a Kids Zone, where kids can get involved and learn about the future of tech in a simple, fun, safe way.
